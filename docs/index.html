<p>Knockup builds on Knockout to give you a complete MVC solution for building RESTful JavaScript web applications. Its only dependency is Knockout, but is compatible with any CommonJS AMD library. There's no silly "Starter Kit", or chain of depenencies that you need to install. Just make sure you've got Knockout and Knockup, and you're ready to start coding.</p>

<h2>Conventions</h2>

<p>Knockup makes a few design choices for you to keep things as simple as possible:</p>

<ol>
<li>You define your model by passing an object to the <code>ku.model</code> function and it returns a constructor for that model.</li>
<li>Any property passed in becomes observable and its value is used as the default.</li>
<li>Functions prefixed with <code>read</code> or <code>write</code> become computed observables. All other functions are just normal instance methods.</li>
<li>If you pass in a model, that property will always contain an instance of that model.</li>
<li>If you pass in a model collection, that property will always contain a collection of its corresponding models.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Currently, there is only one example that shows off most knockup / knockout features.</p>

<p>I had to FORCE myself from doing a todo app!</p>
